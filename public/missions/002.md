# Mission // #002
## Secure the Operative

The Phlegethon-2’s operative in Viridian went dark three weeks ago. The planet is currently a hotspot of pirate activity, courtesy of the White Vipers, and the Baronic Detail is scattered.

# Main Goals
- Locate, contact, and extract operative **RITO IVANOV,** as well as his data.

# Side Goals
- Establish friendly contact with one or more Barons in Couverte.
- Gather information on increased White Viper pirate activity.
- Investigate the false outgoing communication from Viridian.

# Stakes
- What little of Ivanov’s information was received radically alters Union’s understanding of the situation; failure to secure both operative and data risks exposing Union’s involvement and arming unpredictable groups with dangerous knowledge.

# Reserves
- **SCOUTING:** Operative Sparrowhawk has gathered information on relevant pirate activity in and around Couverte, and will brief the party upon rendezvous.
- **SATTELITE SCAN:** One of the Phlegethon-2's scanner satellites has been made available for this mission. 1/mission while in a narrative scene, you may request a detailed overhead image of an area measuring roughly 100m x 100m.
