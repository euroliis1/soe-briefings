# UNS-SL *Greensboro* Supply Transport Vessel // 8.1.5016U
The UNS-SL *Greensboro* enters Baronic Space, carrying medical and technological resources to the Dawnline Shore. Lancers **CACTUS, JAVELIN, NIGHTINGALE,** and **SCREWDRIVER,** as well as the rest of the non-essential crew, are awakened from stasis. Dr. Ernest Price greets them, ensuring their vital functionings are stable and explaining their job: the party is tasked with protecting the UNS-SL *Greensboro* as it travels through pirate-occupied territory, supporting Mirrorsmoke efforts in the region. They're restricted to the stern side of the *Greensboro* for the time being, where they eat breakfast and socialize.

At lunchtime, an alarm goes off in the *Greensboro.* Via intercom, Dr. Price informs the party that pirates have boarded the vessel, and the group heads to the cargo bay to confront the invaders. **SCREWDRIVER** and **JAVELIN** engage offensive maneuvers while **CACTUS** and **NIGHTINGALE** focus on support and debilitation, swiftly taking care of the situation. As the pirates are routed, an unidentified ship docks with the hole caused by the pirates' breach, and a series of subaltern robots begins taking the *Greensboro's* cargo. Following instructions from a pair of voices, the party also boards the new vessel, where it is revealed that the *Greensboro* had released the cargo bay and its actual role was to deliver the cargo and the party to a mysterious group under the guise of a transport mission.

The new ship approaches a space station, previously invisible through cloaking devices, and boards. Upon arrival, the party is greeted by **Commander Raymond Cayde | BIG LUG** and **XO HADES | CHTHON,** who introduce the station as the PHLEGETHON-2 and inform the party that they are now officially dead.
